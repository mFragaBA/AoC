# This year's goal

- do not slack off (at least not too early)
- 1 different lang every week (last year I tested 1 different lang every day but ended up spending more time hacking the process of learning a new lang rather than actually thinking solutions)
- Whenever I have time, I want to write some notes about how I got to the solution

## Week 1

This week's language is gonna be [odin](https://odin-lang.org/) (props to [@lucypero](https://www.github.com/lucypero) for the shilling)

- [Day 1 Notes](./d1/notes.md)
- [Day 2 Notes](./d2/notes.md)
